# kernelPCA_LDA_ClassificationProblem

Kernel PCA and LDA methods were used on MNIST dataset and "labelled faces in the wild" dataset. Cross Validation Method and Grid Search was used in order to find the best hyperparameters. Some more algorithms were used, such as kNN and NCC, in order to compare the results from SVM.
